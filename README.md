# FizzBuzz
This is another challenge project for the Java-Course on Codecademy.
The scope of this project was to write a programm that prints "Fizz" for the multiples of 3
and "Buzz" for the multiples of 5 in an array of 100 numbers. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints FizzBuzz.

## Here is the official project scope from the Codecademy-Website:

### Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question; so common it’s almost cliché!

The challenge is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve coding problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Numbers replaced with Fizz and Buzz as appropriate.
Write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:

For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
